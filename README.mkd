Benjamin
=======

[Bencode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bencode) Java minimalistic library. Takes lightweight approach of using built-in Java types as Bencode type equivalents. Provides simple and effective interface base on Java I/O streams and leverages use of JDK-provided exceptions. Tested with high code coverage.

##### Why to use Benjamin instead of other Bencode Java libraries?

It has simplest API imaginable. All too familiar Java collection classes. There should be no learning curve for such a small thing as bencoding library, I'm sure.
